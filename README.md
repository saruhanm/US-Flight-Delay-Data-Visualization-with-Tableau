## Introduction
This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The aim of the project is to create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Summary
 I downloaded The data set which contains information on United States flight delays, delay times and reasons from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp.   
     
The points I observed are:  
- Delayed air traffic related to weather conditions. 
- Change in air traffic delay pattern through the year 
- Delays caused by security conditions 
- Delayed and arriving flights at a chosen airport 
- Airlines and airports performance

Hi Mehmet,    

I have seen your Tableau visualization about flight delays. I really liked the information and the way you presented. I also think that it would be more beneficial if: 

a)	You had given short names to pages    
b) You prepared a separate page for International Airports only    
c) You prepared a separate page for delays of main carriers (which have certain number of passengers)    

   Best

Upon feedback, I realized that there is a page for every graph in my story which is somewhat confusing. Then I created two dashboards and combined related graphs. Besides, there were some confusing naming in the pages, which I removed.
